                            European fashion scene and this year at Paris Fashion Week they
                            introduced their new collection.

                            Just amazing! That is how i can describe this person. So creative,so inspiring. I was watching her create in her small studio in London and i was amazed at how every
                            little detail gets included in her creaions. From frames,to glass thickness she blew me away...
